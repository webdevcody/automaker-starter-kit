## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) - Full-stack React framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for type-safe queries
- **Authentication**: [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) with email/password authentication
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) components
- **File Storage**: AWS S3/R2 with presigned URL uploads
- **Payments**: Stripe integration for subscriptions
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (via Docker or local installation)
- npm or yarn

## 🏃 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd automaker-starter-kit
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

- Database connection (PostgreSQL)
- Better Auth secrets
- Stripe keys (for payments)
- AWS S3/R2 credentials (for file storage)

### 4. Start the database

```bash
npm run db:up
```

### 5. Run migrations

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

### 6. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📜 Available Scripts

### Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server on port 3000
npm run build        # Build for production (includes type checking)
npm run start        # Start production server
```

### Database

```bash
npm run db:up        # Start PostgreSQL Docker container
npm run db:down      # Stop PostgreSQL Docker container
npm run db:migrate   # Run database migrations
npm run db:generate  # Generate new migration files
npm run db:studio    # Open Drizzle Studio for database management
```

### Payments

```bash
npm run stripe:listen  # Listen for Stripe webhooks in development
```
